Product Requirements Document (Simple Version)
Product Name: EarnNow
Version: 1.2 (Web2-Friendly Rewrite)
Last Updated: 2025-10-24

1. What Is EarnNow?
EarnNow is a shopping rewards platform. You click our merchant links (Shopee, Lazada, Agoda and others), shop like normal, and we give you cashback. At first you just see money (or points) building up in your EarnNow balance. Later, if you want, you can turn part of it into crypto on Base chain. No wallet needed to start. Wallet only if and when you feel ready.

2. Why Does This Matter? (Problems Today)
• Shoppers leave money on the table: Many don’t use affiliate links or rewards; they miss easy savings.
• Confusing cashback systems: Long waiting times and unclear “pending” status make people give up.
• Crypto feels scary: New users hear about wallets, gas fees, volatility—so they never try it.
• Points that expire: Traditional loyalty points can’t be traded, often expire, and feel low value.
• Weak referrals: Most platforms only reward the first invite; people stop sharing.
• Hard to trust tracking: Users worry “Was my purchase counted?” especially if it takes weeks.
• Merchants lack insight: They can’t easily see which clicks become real, approved purchases.
• Fraud & fake accounts: Inflate costs, reduce real user rewards.
Result: Low adoption of crypto rewards and wasted value for everyday shoppers.

3. Our Solution (How EarnNow Fixes It)
• Simple start: Email/Google/phone sign-up. Shop immediately—no crypto steps.
• Clear reward stages: Pending → Approved → Available. You always see where your money is.
• Real value first: Get cashback you understand. Only dive into crypto if you choose later.
• Better referrals: Invite friends and a portion of what they earn helps you reach higher tiers.
• Higher tiers = higher rewards: The more you (and your invites) shop, the bigger your cashback percentage.
• Optional upgrade path: When ready, connect a wallet to unlock extra bonuses (NFT boosts, future staking) but never forced.
• Stable option: You can choose stable value (e.g., USDC) later to avoid price swings.
• Merchant transparency: Dashboard shows clicks, conversions, approvals—so they keep funding good rates.
• Anti-fraud guardrails: We watch for fake sign-ups and refund abuse so genuine users earn more.

4. How It Works (User Flow)
Step 1: Sign up (10 seconds).
Step 2: Pick a store on EarnNow and click “Shop”.
Step 3: Complete your purchase like normal on the merchant site.
Step 4: See the purchase appear as “Pending” (usually within 24h).
Step 5: After the merchant’s refund window passes, it becomes “Approved”.
Step 6: Your balance grows. Later phases allow withdrawal or optional crypto conversion.
Step 7: Invite friends, climb tiers, unlock higher cashback.

5. Rewards & Tiers (Simple View)
Starter: Base cashback.
Silver: Reach a modest total of approved rewards → small boost.
Gold: Higher total → bigger boost.
You progress by shopping or by helping invited friends earn. Clear tracker shows “Amount left to next tier”.

6. Cashback Example
A RM100 purchase has a 5% commission = RM5.
We share ~60% (RM3) with you and keep ~40% (RM2) to run the platform. If you are Silver/Gold you get a boost on your portion.

7. What You Can Earn
• Shopping cashback.
• Extra tier boosts.
• Referral progression (earn more by helping others shop, without taking their money).
• Future quests (daily or weekly tasks for small bonus).
• Optional crypto bonuses (after wallet connect, later phase).

8. Why Web2 Users Will Try This
• No jargon at the start—just “shop and earn”.
• Immediate visible pending rewards builds trust.
• Simple language and clear progress bars.
• Choice: stay with normal cashback or explore crypto later.
• Social pull: help friends save, grow together.
• Streak quests and notifications nudge small repeat actions.

9. Merchant Value
• More qualified shoppers: People click because they know they get rewards.
• Better attribution: Clear funnel (click → pending → approved).
• Controlled cost: We only pay out on verified, non-refunded purchases.
• Ability to test higher commission for specific campaigns.

10. Early Metrics To Track
• Sign-ups per day.
• Time to first pending reward (target <24h after signup for first purchase).
• Pending→Approved conversion rate.
• Referral-generated sign-ups (% of total).
• Tier distribution (how many reach Silver/Gold).
• Repeat purchase rate (30-day retention).
• Fraud flags (should stay very low).

11. Roadmap (Plain Language)
Phase 1 (MVP, weeks 1–12): Basic cashback, single-level referral, three tiers, pending/approved tracking, admin approval tools.
Phase 2 (Months 2–3): Quests, multi-level referral, simple mobile-friendly view, optional wallet connect.
Phase 3 (Months 4–6): NFT & staking bonuses (optional), fiat or voucher withdrawal, stablecoin choice.
Phase 4 (Months 7–12): Smarter reward adjustments, AI shopping recommendations, deeper merchant self-serve tools.

12. Trust & Safety (What We Do Behind The Scenes)
• Catch suspicious sign-ups (same device/IP bursts).
• Wait for refund window before approving rewards.
• Show plain-language status so people don’t feel “left in the dark”.
• KYC only required for large withdrawal amounts later (not for basic browsing or earning).

13. Simpler Token Story (Future Only)
We may introduce our own token later. It will be an “extra bonus” layer—not something you must buy to use EarnNow. We will:
• Keep basic cashback in normal value users recognize.
• Add bonuses for those who opt in to blockchain features.
• Provide stable choices to reduce volatility worries.

14. Plain Risks & Our Responses
Risk: Purchase takes long to appear → We target <24h and show timers.
Risk: People fear “crypto complexity” → We hide crypto until user asks for it.
Risk: Points feel worthless → We tie rewards to real currency value.
Risk: Confusion about status → We use simple words: Pending, Approved.
Risk: Fake referrals → We limit suspicious patterns and do spot checks.

15. Pitch Summary (For Non-Web3 Audience)
“EarnNow helps you get real cashback every time you shop through us. Sign up in seconds, shop like normal, watch your rewards grow. No crypto knowledge needed. When you’re ready, you can unlock extra bonuses with simple blockchain features—but only if you want. Invite friends, move up tiers, and earn more together.”

16. Simple Call To Action
Shop. See Pending. Get Approved. Grow Tiers. Optional: Try Crypto Later.

17. Unique Value Proposition & Alpha Validation
What Makes EarnNow Different (Plain Language)
• Start Like Any Cashback Site: No wallet, no crypto steps—just “shop and earn”.
• Trust You Can See: Every purchase shows up quickly with a clear status (Pending → Approved) and why it’s waiting.
• Rewards That Grow With You: Invite friends and keep shopping to unlock higher tiers for extra cashback—simple, visible progress bar.
• Optional Web3 Upside, Never Forced: You can stay in normal money mode forever; crypto features (wallet connect, future NFT boosts) are an add-on, not a barrier.
• Stable On-Ramp: Future option to keep part of rewards in a stable value so volatility doesn’t scare new users.
• Cleaner Experience Than Traditional Loyalty: No expiring, opaque points; you see a clear currency value in RM terms.
• Smart Anti-Fraud Behind the Scenes: Fake referrals and refund abuse are filtered so real users aren’t penalized.
• Merchant-Friendly Transparency: Merchants get simple funnel insight (clicks vs approved) increasing their confidence to offer better rates.

Why This Stands Out vs Typical Cashback Platforms
1. Progressive Crypto Path: Others make crypto mandatory or ignore it; we separate “cashback now” from “explore later” so mainstream users don’t bounce.
2. Visible Reward Journey: Many sites hide pending logic; we surface it plainly with expected timing to reduce anxiety.
3. Social Growth Loop: Tier progress partially fueled by referrals without taking anything from the friend’s reward—encourages authentic sharing.
4. Future Upgrade Hooks (NFT / Staking) Designed as Bonuses: They enhance, not replace, the base experience.
5. Unified Value View: One balance page (cashback + future extras) cuts through the clutter of multiple voucher and point systems.

Alpha Build Validation (What We’ve Already Proved)
• Fast Signup: Tested flow averages under 30 seconds (email or Google) → removes early friction.
• First Reward Visibility: Test purchases appear as Pending within ~12–24 hours, confirming tracking works.
• Clear Status Language: User testing showed fewer “Where is my cashback?” questions after adding simple status labels.
• Tier Tracker Works: Moving from Starter to Silver changes displayed boost (e.g., +10%) validating dynamic reward math.
• Referral Attribution: Invited user’s approved cashback adds qualifying credit to referrer—confirmed in ledger without deducting invitee’s amount.
• Fraud Guardrails: Velocity limits flagged test batches of rapid fake sign-ups; real users unaffected.
• Admin Oversight: Manual approve/reject tools allow clean correction of edge cases (refunds, duplicate entries).
• Scalable Data Model Start: Append-only ledger keeps a transparent trail (pending → approved) preparing for future audits.

Early Signals of Product-Market Fit (Indicators)
• Test Users Prefer “Cashback First”: Higher engagement when crypto messaging is tucked behind an optional “Learn More” panel.
• Reduced Drop-Off: Removal of forced wallet connect increased completion of first purchase click events in trials.
• Positive Feedback on Clarity: Users report they “understand what’s happening” due to simple pending/approved wording.

Next Validation Steps
• Add simple daily quests → measure repeat visit uplift.
• Pilot optional wallet connect with small bonus → track conversion from Web2 to Web3 features.
• Introduce stable value display (RM equivalent) → measure reduction in volatility concerns.
