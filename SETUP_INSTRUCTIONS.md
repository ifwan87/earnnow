# 🎉 EarnNow Authentication - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Done

I've successfully enabled the authentication system for your EarnNow application! Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **New Files Created**

#### Authentication & User Management
- **`middleware/auth.js`** - Authentication middleware for protecting routes
- **`models/userStore.js`** - In-memory user storage with password hashing
- **`.env`** - Environment configuration (SESSION_SECRET, PORT, etc.)
- **`.env.example`** - Template for environment variables

#### Documentation
- **`AUTH_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive authentication documentation
- **`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - This file!
- **`test-auth.js`** - Quick test script to verify modules
- **`commit-changes.sh`** - Script to commit and push changes

### 2. **Updated Files**

#### server.js - Major Updates
- ✅ Added session management (express-session)
- ✅ Added cookie parsing (cookie-parser)
- ✅ Implemented POST /login route with validation
- ✅ Implemented POST /signup route with validation
- ✅ Protected /dashboard and /rewards routes
- ✅ Added /logout route
- ✅ Integrated user authentication flow

## 🚀 How to Run Your Application

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- express-session
- cookie-parser
- bcryptjs
- All other existing dependencies

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🔐 Login Credentials

### Pre-created Test Account
- **Email**: `m.ifwan@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

You can login immediately with these credentials!

### Create New Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Fill in your details
3. Password must be at least 6 characters
4. You'll be automatically logged in after signup

## 📋 To Commit and Push to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Enable authentication system with login/signup functionality"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Or simply run the provided script:
```bash
chmod +x commit-changes.sh
./commit-changes.sh
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Test the Authentication Flow

1. **Test Login**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use: m.ifwan@gmail.com / password123
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard

2. **Test Signup**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
   - Create a new account
   - You'll be automatically logged in

3. **Test Protected Routes**
   - Try accessing /dashboard without logging in
   - You'll be redirected to /login
   - After login, you can access dashboard and rewards

4. **Test Logout**
   - Click logout or go to /logout
   - You'll be logged out and redirected to homepage

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login/signup form
2. Server validates credentials
3. Password is hashed/compared using bcryptjs
4. Session is created with express-session
5. User ID is stored in session
6. Protected routes check session for user ID
7. User data is retrieved from userStore

### Security Features
- ✅ Password hashing with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
- ✅ HTTP-only session cookies
- ✅ Session expiry (24 hours)
- ✅ Input validation on login/signup
- ✅ Secure session secret from .env

### User Data Structure
Each user has:
- Unique ID
- Name, Email, Hashed Password
- Tier (Starter, Silver, Gold)
- Balance (pending, approved, available)
- Referral code
- Creation date

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Setup (Development)
- **In-Memory Storage**: User data is stored in RAM
- **Data Loss**: Users will be lost when server restarts
- **Single Server**: Won't work with load balancers

### For Production (Future)
You should:
1. ✅ Replace in-memory storage with a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
2. ✅ Change SESSION_SECRET to a strong random value
3. ✅ Enable HTTPS
4. ✅ Add rate limiting
5. ✅ Implement email verification
6. ✅ Add password reset functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors
```bash
npm install
```

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Change PORT in .env file
PORT=3001
```

### Session not working
- Clear browser cookies
- Check that .env file exists
- Restart the server
